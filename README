CIFAR10 images machine learning classifier written in python using PyTorch.

The input file must be all of the five standard, 10000-images, binary files
concatenated into a single one.

Network layout consists in three 2D-convolutional layers followed by two fully
connected layers.

Just for educational purposes. Performance improvements and hyperparameter
tweakings must be done; and a proper evaluation step should be implemented.
